## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the IMDb movie dataset. We will explore various aspects of the data, such as movie ratings, genres, and release years, and visualize the findings using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDb movie dataset, which contains information about movies, including titles, genres, ratings, and more. You can download the dataset from IMDb Dataset or from the one provided in the uploaded zip file.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:
 1)Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
 2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of ratings, genres, and other features.
 3)Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data.

## Results
The results of the analysis include various insights that were drawn out of the dataset provided.Different visualizations have been used to make the understanding of the insights much easier.Some of the finfings include:
 1) The distribution of movie ratings.
 2)The most popular genres over the years.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Make sure to follow the coding standards and include tests for any new features.
